# Developer's Survey Visualization

In this project, I worked with the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2019 data to create a dashboard. 
The dashboard contains the following sections:

## Current Technology Usage

- Top 10 Languages
- Top 10 Databases
- Platforms
- Top 10 WebFrameworks

## Future Technology Trends

- Top 10 Languages desired for the next year
- Top 10 Databases desired for the next year
- Desired platforms for the next year
- Top 10 WebFrameworks desired for the next year

## Demographics

- Respondent classified by gender
- Respondent count for countries
- Respondent count by age
- Respondent count by gender and classified by education level

This dashboard aims to provide insights into current technology usage, future technology trends, and demographic characteristics of survey respondents.
